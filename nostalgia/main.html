        <h1>Sunday, October 22nd, 2006</h1>
        <p>Hey guys! Thanks for all the lovely comments. I’m so sorry for the lack of updates. School is such a nag, and
            the end of the marking period is in about 2 weeks so I have to make sure I’m performing up to standards in
            all of my classes. So basically, I think my only updates are 12 new “other” icons. They’re like a lot of
            cropped fashion icons, that I thought were really cute. I was not in the graphic-making mood last week, but
            now I feel like making some backgrounds or PSDs xP So wait on those… and besides updates… eh, I just don’t
            really care much about anything now. Like, I’m not obsessing over hits or comments or anything at the moment
            -hopefully that’ll change because I mean, I really love owning a site like this :)</p>

        <p>Well, so much has happened since the 8th, gee, it’s been about 12 days x_x I don’t want to rewrite everything
            that has happened, and I’m sure everyone wouldn’t even want to read through all of it, so I’m going to try
            and condense everything and leave out a whole bunch of crap. Well, there was more friend drama, but I’m not
            going to go into it because its over, and I don’t want to just bring it up again here. I saw the Grudge II
            last Friday with Lauren, Liz, and Ali. I don’t know how scary it was because I basically covered my eyes for
            the most part, hehe. Ali was really scared, so she wanted to go home, so we all went outside to wait for her
            dad. It was freeeezing and we were just jumping up and down, like we were high or something. That was a
            pretty fun night ^_^</p>

        <p>Hmm… guess who has a new crush :oops: Yeah, haven’t had one in a while, and this time, I fell pretty hard. At
            least we talk, and I have like 6 classes with him or something… too bad I don’t sit next to him in like any
            of them -_- Anyway, so, Ali just has to go blab it to him that I like him, since she sits next to him in
            orchestra :o Whatever though, I don’t think it’s a big deal [now]. And well, he’s like not the cutest guy
            out there, and he’s not like “hot” or anything, but he’s pretty cute and he has an amazing personality :D
        </p>

        <p>Uhm, so that’s basically it and all I feel like typing. I’m going to return some comments now, and then watch
            Rush Hour. Leave some love x3</p>

        <h1>Sunday, July 16th, 2006</h1>
        <p>[EDIT] Hey guys! Sorry, I didn’t realize that in IE, you couldn’t get down the comments xD I’ll fix that now!
            And… I added back the voting thing for Outspoken Topsites, so please vote for me! [/EDIT]</p>

        <p>Hm… the updates… I made a new page of “Moved” signs. I realized I didn’t have a lot of signs, so I made some.
            I’m playing around with Photoshop because I want to learn how to use it too :) I was meddling around with MS
            Paint and trying to make a guild layout, and then, I said to myself that I was so glad I had Paint Shop Pro.
            I give a lot of credit to people who use MS Paint and can make really good layouts.</p>

        <p>So I went to go see You, Me, and Dupree on Friday with Liz and Ali. It wasn’t as good or as funny as I
            expected, but it was okay. Ali and Liz thought it was horrible and they wanted to leave in the middle of it,
            but I didn’t want to and I wasn’t going to waste my $10.25 by just walking out of a movie. But I left with
            them like 5 minutes before the movie ended. We went to the Atlanta Bread Company after and were playing Do,
            Date, Ditch. What fun :P Then, walked around and went to Barnes & Nobles. I was reading the Devil Wears
            Prada and when we were leaving, I was still reading and I almost walked out with the book!</p>

        <p>Well, I took some really funny music survey thing:</p>

        <p>
            1. Put your music player on shuffle.<br>
            2. Press forward for each question.<br>
            3. Use the song title as the answer to the question even if it doesn’t make sense. no cheating.

        <h1>Tuesday, July 11th, 2006</h1>
        <p>Haven’t done anything lately. I really want to go see Pirates of the Caribbean : Dead Man’s Chest. Do you say
            Ca-rib-be-an, or Car-i-bbean? If you know what I’m talking about, hehe. I Ca-rib-be-an, but I think the
            other way is correct. Whatever. I went swimming at Liz’s house on Sunday. Before, I was outside on my back
            porch with my sister and we were tanning. It was way sunny finally. So, my sister came with me to Liz’s
            pool, it was fun. My brother wanted to come to the pool, and so my mom asked if she could go to watch
            Steven, but that would be weird. Like my mom at my friend’s pool. Besides, the pool was too deep for him.
            Thankfully, she was like, “nevermind.” I think she realized it would be weird.</p>

        <p>Argh, I have a little issue/choice, and I’m just going to write about it, and if I could get some advice,
            that’d be great :) Okay, so my sister is going to Washington D.C. for some leadership program. My dad has to
            drive here there, so he was also thinking that I would go and while Sharon (my sister) is doing whatever, my
            dad and I could just stay there too and do some stuff. But she leaves on August 2 and comes back August 12.
            On August 5, it’s Warped Tour, and I already paid 50 bucks for my ticket and half of Liz’s dad’s ticket
            (since he’s taking us), and I don’t know. Both are like opportunities that won’t come again for a while
            (Warped could be next year, but not like I’m going to get my 50 bucks for this year back). So I don’t know
            what to do :(</p>

        <p>Well, leave me some love x3 I’m going to go return comments.</p>
