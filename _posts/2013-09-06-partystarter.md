__PartyStarter__ is solving the problem of coordinating funds for group events. Built during the fall 2013 [PennApps](http://2013f.pennapps.com/), “It’s like [Kickstarter](http://kickstarter.com/) for parties”, where users connect via [Venmo](http://venmo.com/) to fund a party or potentially host a party. Hosts can choose to use flexible funding (or not) for events that will take place regardless of the total raised. All funds are kept in an escrow account until the time of the party, or refunded to users in the case of a cancelled event. I really enjoyed conceiving and implementing the design and front-end for this hack, building the user experience with [Ember.js](http://emberjs.com/), HTML, CSS, and Photoshop.
