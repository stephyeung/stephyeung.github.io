__Gilbert__ was developed during the inaugural spring 2013 [MHacks](http://mhacks.org/). The idea spawned from a previous hackathon experience we had developing an iOS application. We realized that we spent too much time just creating views and wanted to streamline the process. Gilbert takes JSON and parses it into Objective-C and HTML/CSS to generate mobile and web views easily. We used [Ace](http://ace.ajax.org/) and [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) to power our application. My main role was writing the HTML/CSS parser in JavaScript.
