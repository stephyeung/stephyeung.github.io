For the term project in our HCI course, my team designed, prototyped, and user-tested, a mobile pressure ulcer assessment tool, which we also submitted to the Mobilizing Data for [Pressure Ulcer Prevention Challenge](http://www.health2con.com/devchallenge/mobilizing-data-for-pressure-ulcer-prevention-challenge/), sponsored by the US Department of Health. We took a user-centered approach and conducted interviews with local hospitals, nursing homes, and research facilities, throughout the course of our prototyping. Our final mobile web application was written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
